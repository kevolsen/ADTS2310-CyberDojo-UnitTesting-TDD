<h1>CyberDojo Unit Testing using TDD</h1>

Part 3 of the first obligatory assignment in <a href="https://student.oslomet.no/en/studier/-/studieinfo/emne/ADTS2310/2024/H%C3%98ST">ADTS2310 Software Testing</a> at Oslo Metropolitan University. This repository contains two projects that apply unit testing and Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles using Python and Pytest.
<br /><br />

<h3>Part 1: 12 Days of Christmas</h3>
This project focuses on generating the lyrics of the traditional song "12 Days of Christmas." The development follows a structured TDD approach:
<ul>
  <li>Created a testing plan to validate individual verses and the complete song.</li>
  <li>Developed incremental unit tests, starting from the first two lines of the first verse and expanding to the entire song.</li>
  <li>Implemented functions iteratively, ensuring all tests pass before progressing.</li>
  <li>Refactored code for efficiency, using list-based data structures and iteration.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Part 2: Yatzy Scoring</h3>
This project implements the scoring system for the dice game Yatzy using a TDD methodology.
<ul>
  <li>Defined and implemented unit tests for various Yatzy scoring rules.</li>
  <li>Wrote corresponding functions in an iterative manner, ensuring all tests passed at each stage.</li>
  <li>Addressed game rules including Chance, Yatzy, number categories, pairs, three/four of a kind, straights, and Full House.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Pytest</li>
  <li>Cyber-Dojo</li>
</ul>
